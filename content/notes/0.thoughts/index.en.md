What's the problem?

Actually u don't know.

But you have the feeling to do the right thing. Or do rightly. ME & UP.

You know many skills to do well, but u don't know do what, or be what.

What you are chasing is to be better?

Maybe.

**But is it necessary to rule your actions?**

Think about those you want to be.

Keep **SIMPLE**.

Because the more complex, the more fragile.
